Comment: Imagine making 60fps videos with photos from OAI images. nothing on the internet can be trusted
Comment: Not in Chelsea but Washington square park has the pigeon whisperer. Bear in mind he’s definitely eccentric and curses a lot so might not be a family friendly guy to talk to.

Sorry to hear that man, in the future you may want to have multiple granaries, one close to your berries/deer/fish and one for your veggies/apples/honey.
Incredible stuff! How did you maintain character consistency? Did you generate a consistent character image and then use the image-to-video feature?
It’s pretty hard to get consistent characters when they’re photorealistic tbh. I guess our eyes are more lenient when it’s cartoon.
Can’t really discuss this without your strategy. If you’re setting up on the coast over river, your strategy must involve maritime trades.

This happens when you are in an advanced technological era than the AI. You can adjust to only give them gold, or other resources which you might not need (e.g. iron/coal).

Still buying options?
Seeking advice: I’ve made some gains buying put options this month, but I’ve not been doing call option spread.
Crazy gains, what now? Should I cash out or double down on puts?

Yeah but it doesn’t seem to affect much though
Incredible stuff! How did you maintain character consistency? Did you generate a consistent character image and then use the image-to-video feature?
I do too but I rarely finish a game haha. Too little late game content
You have to kill the bandit units, or donate crop yields though the manor (tithing, different from taxation).
Yeah I was doing alright and then as soon as I upgraded to tier 3 my town was in shambles. I didn’t notice how demanding it was going to be
So in general each family will eat each type of food equally. Which means those with low supply are more likely to be consumed first.
I build my cities close to the borders of others, that way I'm not managing multiple cities at once. The best is building it at the three-way border. That way you're basically managing three cities at once.
Breakfast - Buvette
Coffee - Lyria
Lunch - Tsukemen okiboru
Coffee - La cabra
Dinner - Isodi
Drinks - Double chicken please
how did you make that diagram? I've been doing it in ascii lol

Any tips for photo realism would be appreciated!
Closest expression is naraku ochi 奈落落ち which means falling from the stage, used in kabuki. It’s a way to say going to hell, but neither the literal translation nor the actual meaning is an expression for child suicide.
Fyi it says

Can’t really discuss this without your strategy. If you’re setting up on the coast over river, your strategy must involve maritime trades. Also means you benefit from other cities being on the coast. It also means you need some navy to protect your shipping routes and coastal cities.

Sounds like X
He used to shoot well and have impact when no one had him on the radar, and opponents didn’t have him on their scouting report.
Not in Chelsea but Washington square park has the pigeon whisperer. Bear in mind he’s definitely eccentric and curses a lot so might not be a family friendly guy to talk to.
Also the corner of 46th and 6Av always has insane number of pigeons. Like a lot.

Millenials have less kids, so they have more time and money to spend on themselves. Millenials are also getting married less and later in life, meaning we allocate more effort on self care
